# XSS-Cross-Site-Scripting-
XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) is a web security vulnerability where attackers inject malicious scripts into trusted websites. This allows attackers to steal data, hijack user sessions, or perform unauthorized actions. XSS occurs mainly in three forms: Stored, Reflected, and DOM-based. It's exploited via user input fields or URLs.
